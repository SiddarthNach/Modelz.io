## Day 1 — [06-25-2025]

Today I spoke to Vaughn about the project and the scope.

**Today’s task:** Using an API to call OpenRouter’s providers page for each LLM model. Obviously, I couldn’t do it for all models, but I tried for DeepSeek.

**Takeaways:**

- Do **NOT** EXPOSE YOUR API KEYS (learned the wrong and hard way)  
  - Learned about the gitignore method that doesn’t store or push the API file/env you declare  
- You cannot access every LLM model because you don’t have enough tokens  
  - Used open source models (did not work in the end but at least the code ran)  
- BeautifulSoup is good ol’ reliable, can’t go wrong  
- Selenium is able to open a new Chrome page itself, execute some functions like clicking “show __ more” button  
- Pairing Selenium with BeautifulSoup allowed me to get all the providers’ names  
- Also looked into inspect element and command + F to find specific fields, and saw similarities to actually have the code call them
